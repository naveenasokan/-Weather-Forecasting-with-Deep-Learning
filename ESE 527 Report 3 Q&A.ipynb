    "\n",
    "Decisions to be impacted :\n",
    "In the context of weather forecasting, machine learning plays a very important role in helping us predict f\n",
    "uture weather conditions and also the accuracy of our predictions. These predictions play a crucial role in many real-world applications. Some of them include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Agriculture:\n",
    "\n",
    "Crop planting: Decisions on when to plant a crop is highly dependent on the weather. If the region is expecting famine during crop planting, then the farmer might undergo huge losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Irrigation: Farmers can decide on how much water would be needed based on future weather data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pest Control: Many pests thrive on warmer climates where there is high CO2 levels in the soil. Controlling when to use pesticides and how much pesticides should be used is critical to crop survival.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transportation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Flight and Shipping schedules: it is important for flight and shipping companies to know the weather conditions so that they can reroute in case of bad weather conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Public transport Operations: In case of severe weather, the public might need more access to public transport and knowing weather conditions beforehand can help them be prepared.\n",
    "\n",
    "Emergency and Disaster Management:\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource allocation: The government can provide the necessary resources to the public when they have managed procuring large quantities of food, water etc.,\n",
    "\n",
    "Evacuations: The government and the public can know about the evacuation plans and can better prepare their home and shelter to bear the brunt of the disaster.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business values:\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this project is to help the society to be better prepared in terms of future weather. As seen in the past, hurricanes and snowfall can cause a lot of property damage and have a wrongful impact on the everyday activities of a human being. This project aims to minimize these situations and improve the current weather forecasting applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Assets:\n",
    "\n",
    "While we did consider utilising the NOAA data as our original dataset, the hurricane Helene caused major outages due to which we had to change our data to Open Meteo historical data API. O\n",
    "ur dataset now containes 32 features\n",
    "and 1086120 samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictive analytics: the data from open Meteo contains past data(from the year 2000 to Oct 11 2024) which forms the core of our features which are required for modelling. An irrigation scheduling machine can predict rain in the\n",
    "next few days, asking a farmer to use lesser water than usual.\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive Analytics: Since we have used past data, we can easily catch the trends and seasonality in our models. For example, the transportation department can assess the past weather data patterns to determine when bad\n",
    "weather conditions can be expected, so that rerouting could be done in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prescriptive Analytics: The government can use prescriptive analytics to determine how many bags of grains will be required during a disaster by analyzing previous trends."

    "\n",
    "#### Answer: \n",
    "In our LSTM model we will be having an feature embedding layer which could take in encoded city names. This would make sure that we handle Los angeles different than to St louis. We chose all the cities based on the fact that they have very different weather conditions. We wanted to consider these cities because they represent the variation in temperature across different regions in the US. We dont need to do any seperate preprocessing for this. In additinal we have some features based on geography and topography, like wind and soil temperature in various elevations.\n"

    "\n",
    "#### Answer:\n",
    "As far as our data processing goes, we do not have any cities where snowfall occurs throughout the year. The cities that we have considered are all different in terms of their weather. Our aim is to use a general model that can predict the weather patterns of all the 5 cities and we are still in the process of seeing how this goes. But in future if we are considering cities like with heavy rainfall and snowfall, then yes that should be modelled serperately. Example Columbia in South america, it rains almost everyday and weather patter in alaska are significantly different."

    "\n",
    "#### Answer: \n",
    "We will be using LSTM and 1D-CNN for weather forecasting. Either of the models cannot predict long-term changes in data. LSTMs and CNNs are effective for short- to medium-term weather prediction as they capture temporal and spatial patterns present in historical data. For this project, our aim is to predict weather for 1-2 days ahead. But if we waant model to account for loing term changes like an year ahead , then we need to consider climate simulation models."

    "#### 6) How are you accounting for the microclimate effect in Los Angeles? That is an extremely sprawling area, and being situated in between mountains and the ocean causes a great deal of variability in weather conditions across the city.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Answer: \n",
    "For our weather prediction model, we treat Los Angeles as a single entity rather than dividing it into sub-regions, focusing on capturing general patterns across the city.This simplifies the model design and is suitable for capturing general weather patterns across the city.\n",
    "\n",
    "To account for the variability across cities, including Los Angeles and its neighbors, we use a single model that incorporates a dedicated embedding layer to encode city names, enabling the model to distinguish city-specific weather patterns. \n",
    "\n",
    "However in phase 2 of this project that we are currently working, For regions with significant microclimatic variability, such as Los Angeles and its neighboring cities, we build a single city model. We have taken new york in our case. It could be done for cities with microclimatic varaition. We enhance the model with topographical features like elevation, proximity to the coast, and geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) to better represent spatial dependencies. As with the combined model, we use an embedding layer to encode city names. This allows the model to understand and account for city-specific differences within the combined dataset."

We have also performed log transformation on the vpd feature values to check for skewness. We also have a scatterplot of the different wind speeds and soil temperatures.

    "We are going to train on both of the above methods. But we are more leaning towards the a single model for all 5 cities. For that we will be having an additional layer both in LSTM and CNN, feature embedding layer where the cities would be encoded and fed as an additional input \n",

    "#### Answer: \n",

    "\n",
    "#### Answer:\n",
    "The reason for this is because, all of the cities that we have considered do not have daily rainfall. On the few days that rainfall occurs, it is not a very significant amount. Since we have considered hourly data, most of our values for rain is 0. This would be the common trend right if you consider countries like USA.

In our case for wind_speed_10m and 100m were correlated. Similarly soil_temp_depth10m and 100m were correlated. So we opt to remove one of them which ahs the least corrleation with the target temperature."

    "\n",

    "As seen from the covariance matrix (Heatmap), only few of our data points had high correlation. For example, wind_speed_10m and wind_speed_100m were two different variables but they had high correlation so we decided to drop one of those values. Whenever we observe high correlation, we can just drop either of the features. High correlation implies that both the features contribute equally to the prediction."

    "\n",
    "#### Answer:\n",
    "Like all weather prediction models, our model can appproximate the weather conditions for 1-2 days ahead but an absolute prediction might be hard to make. With respect to St Louis, we have observed some patterns and seasonality in our data... although the winters in St louis are quite out of box. It sometimes even drops beyond chicago's weather. Chcicago which is very close to St louis, however has very cold climate. It might be due to the lake or mountain that passes through. So the best model to fit all this would be a unique model for some cities  (like stl and chicago). We are  into building a single model and also unique model for each cities\n",

    "These cities were chosen due to their high variation in different weather patterns. For example, St Louis experiences extreme weather conditions whereas Houston remains warm for most parts of the year. Likewise, LA is known for its pleasant weather and Chicago, New York are known for their harsh winters. All these weather patterns are different from each other which makes our problem more challenging."

    "\n",
    "#### Answer:\n",
    "The differences in local geography (e.g., mountains, coastlines) and microclimates starts playing a larger role. In winter ST louis and chicago are almost similarly cold (They may both be influenced by a cold front moving through the Midwest), however in summer St louis stays very hot. But cites which are very closer to each other might experience similar wetaher pattern. Hoever for this project, we took a different cities which are widely apart. So we couldnt find any correlation between the cities.\n",
