    "\n",
    "Decisions to be impacted :\n",
    "In the context of weather forecasting, machine learning plays a very important role in helping us predict f\n",
    "uture weather conditions and also the accuracy of our predictions. These predictions play a crucial role in many real-world applications. Some of them include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Agriculture:\n",
    "\n",
    "Crop planting: Decisions on when to plant a crop is highly dependent on the weather. If the region is expecting famine during crop planting, then the farmer might undergo huge losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Irrigation: Farmers can decide on how much water would be needed based on future weather data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pest Control: Many pests thrive on warmer climates where there is high CO2 levels in the soil. Controlling when to use pesticides and how much pesticides should be used is critical to crop survival.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transportation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Flight and Shipping schedules: it is important for flight and shipping companies to know the weather conditions so that they can reroute in case of bad weather conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Public transport Operations: In case of severe weather, the public might need more access to public transport and knowing weather conditions beforehand can help them be prepared.\n",
    "\n",
    "Emergency and Disaster Management:\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource allocation: The government can provide the necessary resources to the public when they have managed procuring large quantities of food, water etc.,\n",
    "\n",
    "Evacuations: The government and the public can know about the evacuation plans and can better prepare their home and shelter to bear the brunt of the disaster.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business values:\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this project is to help the society to be better prepared in terms of future weather. As seen in the past, hurricanes and snowfall can cause a lot of property damage and have a wrongful impact on the everyday activities of a human being. This project aims to minimize these situations and improve the current weather forecasting applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Assets:\n",
    "\n",
    "While we did consider utilising the NOAA data as our original dataset, the hurricane Helene caused major outages due to which we had to change our data to Open Meteo historical data API. O\n",
    "ur dataset now containes 32 features\n",
    "and 1086120 samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictive analytics: the data from open Meteo contains past data(from the year 2000 to Oct 11 2024) which forms the core of our features which are required for modelling. An irrigation scheduling machine can predict rain in the\n",
    "next few days, asking a farmer to use lesser water than usual.\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive Analytics: Since we have used past data, we can easily catch the trends and seasonality in our models. For example, the transportation department can assess the past weather data patterns to determine when bad\n",
    "weather conditions can be expected, so that rerouting could be done in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prescriptive Analytics: The government can use prescriptive analytics to determine how many bags of grains will be required during a disaster by analyzing previous trends."

For example, wind_speed_10m and wind_speed_100m were two different variables but they had high correlation so we decided to drop one of those values. Whenever we observe high correlation, we can just drop either of the features. High correlation implies that both the features contribute equally to the prediction."

    "#### Answer:\n",
    "Like all weather prediction models, our model can appproximate the weather conditions for 1-2 days ahead but an absolute prediction might be hard to make. With respect to St Louis, we have observed some patterns and seasonality in our data which might make it easier to predict the weather. Some locations like LA have almost the same weather conditions which might make it easier to predict, but there are other factors which might not allow for perfect predictions."
