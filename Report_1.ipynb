    "## Project Description\n",
    "### 4.1 [Problem Definition]\n",
    "#### i. What is the Research Problem that you will be addressing using an Analytical Framework?\n",
    "The primary objective of this project is to address the suboptimal accuracy of short-term temperature forecasting by leveraging a hybrid deep learning approach that combines 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Traditional forecasting models, such as Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) systems, rely heavily on physical simulations of atmospheric phenomena. While these models are effective for long-term weather predictions, they often struggle with short-term variability, particularly in highly dynamic local weather conditions. By integrating 1D CNNs to extract local features with LSTMs to model long-term dependencies, this research aims to enhance the precision of short-term temperature forecasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### *Current vs. Desired Performance Gap*:\n",
    "\n",
    "Current State: Current short-term temperature forecasts using NWP models typically exhibit an average error of ±2°C to ±3°C, particularly for the 24- to 48-hour forecast range. These errors are a result of the models' limitations in capturing local variability and complex interactions within atmospheric data. Consequently, sectors relying on precise forecasts, such as energy distribution, agriculture, and emergency management, experience inefficiencies and increased risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Desired Future State: The goal is to develop a predictive model using a combination of 1D CNN and LSTM that can reduce the forecast error margin to within ±0.5°C to ±1°C for short-term predictions. The 1D CNN will effectively capture local features and patterns, while the LSTM will model long-term temporal dependencies, leading to improved accuracy over traditional methods. This hybrid approach is expected to provide a significant enhancement in short-term temperature forecasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### *Quantifying the Performance Gap*:\n",
    "\n",
    "Absolute Measure: The current average error in short-term temperature forecasting with NWP models is approximately 2°C. We aim to reduce this error by at least 50%, targeting an absolute improvement of 1°C in forecast accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relative Measure: A comparative analysis will be conducted between traditional NWP methods and the 1D CNN with LSTM-based approach. We anticipate that the hybrid model will demonstrate a 25-50% reduction in forecast error compared to existing systems, particularly when evaluated with real-world meteorological datasets. Additionally, the model's performance will be tested during extreme weather events to assess its robustness and effectiveness compared to traditional methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging the strengths of 1D CNNs for feature extraction and LSTMs for temporal modeling, this project aims to significantly reduce short-term temperature forecasting errors. The enhanced accuracy will offer substantial benefits across weather-sensitive industries, optimizing decision-making processes and improving risk management.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ii. Motivation\n",
    "The motivation for this project stems from the critical need for accurate short-term temperature forecasts in industries sensitive to weather conditions. Sectors such as agriculture, energy, transportation, and disaster management depend on precise temperature predictions for operational efficiency, planning, and risk management. Even modest improvements in forecasting accuracy can yield significant economic and societal benefits. For instance, enhanced temperature forecasts can optimize crop management in agriculture or improve energy grid management, particularly as the reliance on renewable energy sources like wind and solar increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "While traditional NWP models are robust for long-term predictions, they often fail to capture fine-scale temporal and spatial variations in temperature, especially during extreme weather events. By combining 1D CNNs and LSTMs, this project seeks to address these limitations. 1D CNNs will extract relevant local features from time-series data, while LSTMs will capture the temporal dependencies and sequence patterns, providing a more comprehensive approach to short-term forecasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### iii. What decisions will you be impacting?\n",

This contributes to a broader understanding of atmospheric processes, leading to long-term societal benefits in terms of both knowledge and application\n",
    "\n",
    "#### v. Why is this project important to you?\n",
    "This project holds personal significance for me due to past experiences where unexpected weather, particularly sudden rain, has disrupted my day-to-day life. I’ve had several occasions where inaccurate weather forecasts led to major inconveniences—whether it was planning outdoor activities, commuting to work, or simply dressing appropriately for the day. I vividly remember instances when forecasts predicted clear skies, only to have rain pour down unexpectedly, leaving me stranded or unprepared. These experiences highlighted the real-world impact that inaccurate forecasts can have, not just on industries but on individuals and their daily routines.\n",
